Imagine you have a long sequence of repeated characters like this:

AAAABBB1111CCCDD

Your goal is to find a way to be able to compress this sequence and make it shorter, 
while still being able to expand it back to the original. 

For example, this sequence could become 4(A) 3(B) 4(1) 3(C) & 2(D)

It looks simple at first, but think of when the character appears multiple times, 
like hundreds/thousands of times, etc. 

How is your algorithm going to know whether part of the sequence is a character 
or the frequency of characters that are appearing.

The same problem occurs if we want to use something like delimiter. 

If you want to use a colon ( : ) or a space (" " ) or a pipe ( | ), 
how do we know that it is a delimiter or part of the original sequence?
