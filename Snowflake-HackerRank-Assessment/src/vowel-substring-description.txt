Vowel Substring

Given a string composed of lowercase letters within the ASCII range 'a'-'z', 
determine the number of substrings that consist solely of vowels, where each vowel 
appears at least once. The vowels are ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']. A substring is defined 
as a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

Example
s = 'aeioaexaaeuiou'

There is a substring to the left that is made of vowels, 'aeioae' which is followed 
by an 'x'. Since 'x' is not a vowel, it cannot be included in the substring, and this 
substring does not contain all of the vowels. It is not a qualifying substring. Moving 
to the right, there are four substrings that do qualify: 'aaeuiou', 'aaeuio', 'aeuiou' and 'aeuio'.

Function Description
Complete the function vowelSubstring in the editor with the following parameter(s):
    string s: a string

Returns
    int: the number of substrings that consist of vowels only ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
    where every towel appears at least once.

Constraints
    * 1 <= size_of(s) <= 10^5
    * s[i] is in the range ascii['a'-'z'] (where 0 <= i < size_of(s))

Input Format For Custom Testing
    The first line contains a string s.

Sample Case 0
Sample Input for Custom Testing

    STDIN           Function
    -----           --------
    aaeiouxa  ->    s = "aaeiouxa"

    Sample Output
    2

    Explanation
    s = "aaeiouxa"

    There are two qualifying substrings: 
    s[0:5] = "aaeiou" 
    s[1:5] = "aeiou"

Sample Case 1
Sample Input for Custom Testing

    STDIN           Function
    -----           --------
    axyzaeiou ->    s = "axyzaeiou"

    Sample Output
    1

    Explanation
    s = "axyzaeiou"

    There is only one qualifying substring: 
    s[4:8] = "aeiou"
